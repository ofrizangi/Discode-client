<h3> For Loop :</h3>

The for statement creates a loop with 3 optional expressions:

<code>
for (expression 1; expression 2; expression 3) {
  // code block to be executed
}
</code>

Expression 1 is executed (one time) before the execution of the code block.

Expression 2 defines the condition for executing the code block.

Expression 3 is executed (every time) after the code block has been executed.

# Discode

Developed by Ofri Zangi & Sivan Jhirad as part of our final project.

Discode is a website whose goal is to teach programming concepts to children. 
To achieve this, we created games that kids can solve by moving "code blocks" or by writing code.
For more information your'e welcome to watch this video that showcasts the project and its features - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u9fx71CInPc.

## Discode client

This repository consists of the client-side code for this website, which was developed using ReactJS.
Its primary features include:
* Creation of two engaging graphic games through the utilization of Phaser, a versatile 2D game framework.
* An innovative implementation of a recursive drag-and-drop list, allowing you to construct your own block-based code.
* Utilizing classes to generate block-based code into runnable code animating the game charecters.
* Integrating a code editor with the games.
